Structure
	On everything that inherits from SimObject(basicaly every object) there will 
	be a string list of DataInstance objects. You can use the following functions
	to manipulate and access this list and DataInstances.
	DataInstances themselves can have a DataInstance list.


SimObject::DataInstance(%slot)
	%slot	an integer number greater than 0
	return	a DataInstance

	Fetches the DataInstance at the specified slot and create a new one if necessary.

SimObject::DataInstance_Set(%slot,%s)
	%slot	an integer number greater than 0
	%s		any string

	Sets the reference of the specified slot in the DataInstance list to the first word of the %s.
	Useful if you need to add or remove (with an empty string) a reference.

SimObject::DataInstance_Add(%s[,%slot])
	%s		any string
	optional:
	%slot	an integer number greater than 0

	Prepends the first word of %s to the reference at %slot.
	If %slot is empty then it will append at the end of the list.

SimObject::DataInstance_ListGet()
	Useful if you need the list itself for whatever reason.

SimObject::DataInstance_ListSet(%s)
	%s		any string

	Sets the entire list to %s.
	Useful if you need to clear a list (with an empty string) or set it to another list.

SimObject::DataInstance_ListSave()
	Saves the DataInstance list on the object into its file.
	Only works on Player with a client, fxDtsBrick, and DataInstance.
	Will save nested DataInstance lists but will not successfuly save objects in normal fields.

SimObject::DataInstance_ListLoad()
	Loads the DataInstance list of the object from its file.
	Only works on Player with a client, fxDtsBrick, and DataInstance.
